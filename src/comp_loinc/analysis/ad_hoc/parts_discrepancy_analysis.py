# ts=1745185166.474269&cid=C07FD85066L) and he actually said this:
# > The other thing could be that unless a part is directly linked to a LOINC it won't be in the file.  So parts further
# up the tree for grouping are not included.  I'll have to check to verify.
# So either he never said that thing about "100%" and I misunderstood it, or he said it elsewhere, perhaps verbally at
# the all hands meeting.
# Probably best to just pause the analysis here.
